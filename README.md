# Hyper-V-File-Copier
This is just a small python tool, that can helps a lot if you arent familiar with PowerShell and want to copy a File to a Hyper-VM. Be sure you have turned on the Hyper-V guest services and that you have installed the tkinter module! Right in the moment you are only able to copy one File per time. A Folder Copy function will be followed soon.
