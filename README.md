Use at your own risk. I do not recommend using it because it is no longer needed. The functionality is supported by default. This is just a bunch of code that i quickly threw out by the way many years ago


# Hyper-V-File-Copier
This is just a small python tool, that can helps, if you arent familiar with PowerShell and want to copy a File to a Hyper-V-VM. Be sure you have turned on the Hyper-V guest services!

Combobox for choosing the VM, where you want to copy to.
Textbox should display the path of file or folder, if you have selected one.
Checkbox for activate the folder mode. If you check you can copy a folder.(Not Recursive)
Select Button for choose a folder. With the Copy button you start the copy routine!
